## 🎟️ Tickets

Let's get started!

### ✨ Ticket 1 - Getting Started ✨

### Ticket 1a

It's time to create your first python file! Create a file called `main.py`.

### Ticket 1b

Now let's make sure your file is working correctly. Print `Welcome to Python 101` and check that it prints correctly in your console.

💡 If your message isn't printing. Double check that you've installed python properly and revist how to run python code in your console. Hint: It's just like starting a video!

### Ticket 1c

Add a comment above your printed message that says `Ticket 1b`

As you continue through the workshop, it's important to comment your code to track your work and write a plan.

### ✨ Ticket 2 - Food Shopping ✨

Sunday has come around and you realised you forgot to go food shopping! Oh no 😮!

### Ticket 2a

As you have a weekly budget to work with, assign `100` pounds to a variable called `weekly_budget`.

Print `weekly_budget` to your console.

### Ticket 2b

You've arrived to Tesco and as you add coffee and sugar to your basket, you realise you need to calculate how much remaining budget you have.

Create two variables `item_one` and `item_two`. Assign **£3** to `item_one` and **£5** to `item_two`.

Print `item_one` and `item_two` to your console.

### Ticket 2c

Add `item_one` and `item_two` assigning them to the variable `total_spent`.

Next, subtract the remaining `total_spent` from `weekly_budget` and assign it to a variable called `remaining_budget`.

Print `remaining_budget` to your console.
